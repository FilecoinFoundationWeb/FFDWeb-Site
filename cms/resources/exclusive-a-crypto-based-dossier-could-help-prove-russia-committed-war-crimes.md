  This article discusses how Blockchain technology and web3 tools are being used
  to preserve and verify evidence of war crimes, as demonstrated by Starling
  Lab's submission of publicly available online information with a blockchain
  verified chain of custody to the International Criminal Court. This marks the
  first instance of evidence being submitted using blockchain technology,
  ensuring its authenticity and preventing tampering or loss. This approach has
  the potential to enhance transparency and accountability in legal proceedings
  related to war crimes.
