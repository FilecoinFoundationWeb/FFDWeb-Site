  This article explores how the concept of a ‘Decentralised Digital Identity’
  applies to media users or a professional publishing company. We investigate
  how these types of identities can be used to develop trust and extract new
  value in the publishing and media industries. The work is based on the
  research undertaken by the Cogency project in 2022, which assessed how Web3
  can be used to help build ongoing trust and develop new sources of revenue for
  publishers and content producers.
