  This blog post is the announcement of FFDW's collaboration with WITNESS to
  harness the power of the decentralized web, or Web3, to authenticate and
  safeguard human rights records. This partnership underscores the societal
  impact of Web3 by aiming to protect these records from manipulation and loss.
  The FFDW award will bolster WITNESS's efforts in establishing community
  archives, shaping the infrastructure of authenticity, and promoting education
  within vulnerable communities, thereby demonstrating how Web3 can catalyze
  positive social change.
