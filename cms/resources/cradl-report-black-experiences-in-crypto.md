  Black people in the United States are adopting crypto at high rates relative
  to other groups and to traditional financial tools. This report seeks to
  answer why. What are the motivations? What is unique about Black people's
  motivations and participation in crypto? Some of the key takeaways from the
  report are: Participation in crypto is fundamentally altering historic trends
  in traditional approaches to wealth-building amongst Black people in the
  United States, and Narratives around higher crypto adoption rates by Black
  people should be grounded in an understanding of this activity relative to the
  history of investment systems available to them.
