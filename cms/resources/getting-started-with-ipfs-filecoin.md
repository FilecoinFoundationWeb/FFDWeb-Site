  IPFS is a decentralized web protocol for sharing data quickly and easily.
  Filecoin is built on top of IPFS and supports storing data long-term via
  on-chain deals. Together, they help us break free from centralized services
  while conveniently allowing us to enjoy the same luxuries of speed and
  guaranteed storage that centralized services would bring. This page is
  starting point for learning the key concepts behind IPFS and Filecoin and how
  to get started building with them, including developer tools that help you
  store data on both IPFS and Filecoin quickly and easily.
