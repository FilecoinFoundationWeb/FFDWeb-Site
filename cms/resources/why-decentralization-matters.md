  The article outlines the evolution of the internet from its early
  open-protocol phase, through the current era dominated by centralized tech
  giants, to a proposed future "Web 3" era powered by decentralized
  cryptonetworks. It suggests that these cryptonetworks, if they can attract
  sufficient developers and entrepreneurs, could offer superior services and
  innovation, overcoming the drawbacks of centralization such as data control
  and arbitrary rule changes.
