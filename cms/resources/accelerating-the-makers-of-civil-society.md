  TechSoup's Accelerating Makers project, supported by the Filecoin Foundation
  for the Decentralized Web (FFDW), aims to bridge the gap between civil society
  organizations and decentralized web (DWeb) technology. By providing education,
  resources, and community events, the project seeks to introduce civil society
  decision-makers to DWeb technology and enable DWeb Makers to understand the
  needs and challenges faced by civil society organizations, ultimately
  fostering the development of purpose-built, equitable solutions for the
  world's most pressing issues.
