  This Q&A with Guardian Project, an FFDW project partner, explores the
  intersection of decentralized apps (dApps) and social good. It highlights the
  benefits of dApps in terms of data control, privacy, and resilience. The
  article discusses common use cases of dApps, including their application in
  the human rights and humanitarian space, and showcases projects like F-Droid
  and ProofMode that leverage decentralized technologies for secure app
  distribution and verifiable media documentation.
