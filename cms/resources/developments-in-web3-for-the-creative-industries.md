  Developments in Web3 for the Creative Industries identifies how artists,
  musicians, games designers, and other creative practitioners are pushing the
  established boundaries of the creative economy using the tools and platforms
  of web3. The report steers clear of aspirational ‘use cases’ and focusses
  instead on the industrial transformations that have manifested to date,
  including new ways of manufacturing ownership, rewarding and incentivising
  fans to sustain creative projects, and the use of web3 for organising and
  managing collaborative creative endeavours.
