  In this series of six workshops, “Imagining a Better Online World: Exploring
  the Decentralized Web,” we’ll explore the ways in which moving to
  decentralized technologies may enhance your privacy, empower you to control
  your own data, and resist censorship. Join us to hear from experts in the
  leading peer-to-peer technologies, from identity to data storage. We’ll see
  demonstrations of how decentralized tech is being used in publishing, data
  management and preserving cultural assets. Learn how the decentralized web
  might yet create systems that empower individuals by eliminating central
  points of control.
