  Episode 11 explores the transition from Web2, which lets you publish your own
  work, to Web3, which lets you monetize that work. This episode explores the
  shift in thinking from scarcity of access to scarcity of ownership in art, the
  rise of NFTs, and how the dweb allows us to build new spaces and leverage
  existing web2 platforms to create new community spaces.
