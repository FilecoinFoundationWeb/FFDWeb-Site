  F-Droid is an installable catalog of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)
  applications for the Android platform. The client makes it easy to browse,
  install, and keep track of updates on your device. This app repository intends
  to solve the issues of centralized and walled gardens surrounding both Apple's
  and Google's app stores, mitigating censorship using decentralized
  technologies.
