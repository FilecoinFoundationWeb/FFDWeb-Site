  Connect Humanity, a social impact fund, partnered with FFDW to conduct a
  survey of over 7,500 civil society organizations (CSOs) across 136 countries
  to evaluate the state of digital equity worldwide. The findings revealed
  significant barriers to internet access, affordability, digital skills, policy
  implementation, and content availability. Connect Humanity and FFDW aim to
  mobilize resources, knowledge, and solutions to bridge the digital divide,
  ensure equitable access to the internet, and promote a more inclusive and
  equal digital future through education and the development of decentralized
  technologies.
