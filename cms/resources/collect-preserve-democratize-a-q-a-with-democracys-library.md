  Democracy's Library, supported by FFDW and the Filecoin ecosystem, aims to
  address the problem of inaccessible government data by creating backups and a
  centralized repository of verifiable information. Their goal is to make
  government records, research, and data freely and permanently accessible to
  all stakeholders, leveraging technologies like Web3 and decentralization to
  transform the structure of knowledge and facilitate better collective societal
  management. By preserving critical information and breaking data free from its
  constraints, they strive to empower the future of government and enable
  informed decision-making based on historical records and lessons learned.
