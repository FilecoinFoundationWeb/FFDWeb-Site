  Sacred Stacks, a collaborative project by the University of Colorado Boulder's
  Media Economies Design Lab and Center for Media, Religion and Culture,
  explores the potential of decentralized technologies in building stronger
  communities and making a social impact. Partnering with seven activist
  communities, they organized a six-month online learning cohort and created an
  80-page illustrated zine to reflect on the challenges faced by the designers
  of decentralized tools in serving the communities they aim to support,
  emphasizing the importance of technology in cultivating spiritually creative
  "cyborg communities" and fostering social change.
