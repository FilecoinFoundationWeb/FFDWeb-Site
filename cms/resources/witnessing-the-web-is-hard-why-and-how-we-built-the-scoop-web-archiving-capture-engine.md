  This article discusses the development of Scoop, a high-fidelity,
  browser-based, single-page web archiving capture engine built to address the
  needs of the web archiving community, with a particular focus on specificity,
  accuracy, and security. Scoop employs the "no-alteration principle" to ensure
  captured HTTP exchanges remain unprocessed and authentic, and the tool is
  designed with configurability in mind, allowing users to customize their
  capture policies and the way the browser interacts with web pages. To ensure
  authenticity and provenance in a decentralized web archiving process, Scoop
  incorporates mechanisms like a provenance summary feature, preservation of SSL
  certificates, and support for the Web Archive Collection Zipped (WACZ) file
  format and the WACZ Signing and Verification specification, allowing for a
  cryptographic seal on the web archive file​.
