  This article is an announcement for Distributed Press. This project aims to
  offer creators an alternative to centralized platforms by providing a scalable
  and user-friendly no-code publishing platform that has access to decentralized
  platforms such as IPFS and Holepunch. The focus is on empowering individuals,
  reaching the Global South, and serving diverse communities such as activists,
  journalists, offline networks, and artists.
