  The Filecoin Foundation and Protocol Labs are collaborating to store and
  maintain New York City's Open Data on the decentralized web for the next five
  years. This initiative aims to explore the benefits of decentralized data
  storage for public data and city governance, offering a more reliable,
  resilient, secure, and cost-effective archive of the city's public records. By
  moving NYC Open Data onto the decentralized web, the project aims to enhance
  accessibility, accountability, and transparency while preserving the city's
  collective history.
