  FFDW collaborates with MuckRock, a non-profit organization, to leverage the
  Filecoin network and IPFS for preserving public documents and enhancing
  information transparency. MuckRock's DocumentCloud platform enables
  journalists and researchers to request, analyze, and share government
  documents, while decentralized technologies ensure the long-term preservation
  of these critical resources.
