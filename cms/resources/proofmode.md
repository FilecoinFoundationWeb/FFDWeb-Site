  ProofMode operates as an almost invisible utility on your phone, automatically
  adding extra digital proof data to all the photos and videos you capture. This
  data can be conveniently shared with anyone you choose through a "Share Proof"
  action. The purpose of the app is to enhance the credibility and authenticity
  of your media by providing verifiable digital proof.
