  This YouTube video explores the concept of the decentralized web (DWeb), which
  aims to distribute internet resources across connected devices instead of
  centralized entities. It highlights the Guardian Project's ProofMode app,
  which allows activists and organizations to protect their communications and
  data from intrusion, interception, and monitoring, particularly in documenting
  war crimes. The video emphasizes how decentralized solutions like these can
  empower civil society and better serve communities worldwide.
