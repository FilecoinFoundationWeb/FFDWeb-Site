f_blurb: Working with a network of partners, TechSoup supports change makers
  worldwide as they use digital solutions to achieve their own goals. With
  FFDWâ€™s award, TechSoup kicked off a new project, Accelerating Makers,
  dedicated to supporting decentralized technologies in the civil society tech
  stack. Accelerating Makers will support a breed of early-stage creators so
  they can understand and adopt decentralized technologies in their work and
  lives.
