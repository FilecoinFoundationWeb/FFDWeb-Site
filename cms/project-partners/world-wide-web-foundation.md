f_blurb: The Web Foundation advances Sir Tim Berners-Lee's original vision for
  an open web that is safe, trusted, and empowering for all of its users.
  Decades after his invention, over 5 billion people are on the web and it faces
  constant and evolving threats to his vision. This FFDW partnership will help
  to relaunch the Web Index--providing unique data and insights to help better
  understand what is happening in the online lives of its users, shedding light
  on where the Web is going, what emerging issues we should be monitoring, and
  in what areas a course correction is needed.
