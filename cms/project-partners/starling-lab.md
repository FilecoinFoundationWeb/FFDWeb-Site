  FFDW’s commitment to Starling Lab will be used to support their work to
  prototype tools and principles to bring historians, legal experts, and
  journalists into the new era of Web3. In particular, this partnership will
  support the development of open-source tools, best practices, and case studies
  to verifiably document human and civil rights violations, war crimes, and
  testimony of genocide. Starling Lab’s work to preserve human right violations,
  with help of Filecoin’s decentralized storage network, has been highlighted in
  Fast Company and CNN.
