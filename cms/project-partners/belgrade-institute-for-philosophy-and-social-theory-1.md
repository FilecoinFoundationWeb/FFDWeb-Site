f_blurb: With FFDW’s support, this project is collecting, digitizing,
  preserving, interpreting, and distributing information related to cultural
  heritage that various political and cultural authorities have treated as
  “undesirable” or “unworthy” of support. Further, the project works with the
  Filecoin community to demonstrate the importance of libraries and archives
  that cannot be burned or destroyed at the order of a government or a single
  individual.
