f_blurb: With FFDW’s support, this project will collect, digitize, preserve,
  interpret, and distribute information related to cultural heritage that
  various political and cultural authorities have treated as “undesirable” or
  “unworthy” of support and work with the Filecoin community to demonstrate the
  importance of libraries and archives that cannot be burned or destroyed at the
  order of a government or a single individual.
